* "Zorld of Wuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.

* A "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game.  It is 
* connected to other rooms via exits.  The exits are labelled north, 
* east, south, west.  For each direction, the room stores a reference
* to the neighboring room, or null if there is no exit in that direction.
