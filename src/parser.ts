* "Zorld of Wuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.

* This parser reads user input and tries to interpret it as an "Adventure"
* command. Every time it is called it reads a line from the terminal and
* tries to interpret the line as a two word command. 
*
* The parser has a set of known command words. It checks user input against
* the known commands, and invokes a relevant method on the Game object.
